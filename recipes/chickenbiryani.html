    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Marinate the chicken: In a bowl, mix yogurt, garlic paste, ginger paste, green chilies, and a blend of spices.
        Add chicken pieces, coat them well, and let them marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Prepare the rice: Rinse basmati rice until the water runs clear. Soak it in water for about 30 minutes. In a
        large pot, bring water to a boil, add salt and whole spices (like bay leaves, cardamom, and cloves). Add the
        soaked rice and cook until it's about 70% done. Drain and set aside.</li>
      <li>Prepare the fried onions: Thinly slice onions and fry them until golden brown and crispy. Drain them on paper
        towels and set aside.</li>
      <li>Layer the biryani: In a heavy-bottomed pot, layer the partially cooked rice and marinated chicken. Sprinkle
        fried onions and chopped coriander and mint leaves between the layers. Optionally, drizzle saffron milk over the
        layers.</li>
      <li>Dum cooking: Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with dough. Cook on low heat for about 20-25
        minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the chicken to cook through.</li>
      <li>Final touches: Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork, ensuring the layers remain intact. Serve hot,
        garnished with more fried onions, fresh coriander, and mint leaves. Enjoy your flavorful chicken biryani!</li>
